MyJSLibrary works on ES6 Javascript and it's an experiment to understand how to create a library similar to angular and react.

I developed the main class called "component.js" and this one need to be extended by a new Component, which we'll want to create.

#External Libraries
Mustache: Provide to write html with brackets and variables;
Hammy JS: Provide routing.
